# Ongoing Research

**01/2021 - Present**\
**Purdue University Research Comouting**\
_Framework for Understanding and Mitigating Data Center Environmental Footprint_\
In coördination with Research Computing at Purdue University, our team's goal is to build a framework for universities to perform an audit of data center emissions, water and electrical usage, and operations costs to unerstand and reduce the environmental implications of running high-performance computing jobs, while contributing to university-driven Sustainability goals and standards.

**08/2020 - 05/2021**\
**Purdue University & Ford Motor Company**\
_`WHERE` Clause Support for Natural Language Interface to Database Algorithms_\
This research project is an alliance between Ford Motor Company and Purdue University’s Data Mine. Current approaches to the Natural Language Interface to Database (NLIDB) problem (an extension of Natural Language to SQL for relational databases) ignores WHERE clause prediction, making them unusable in industry. We aim to close this gap by developing a WHERE clause predictor to implement in models on Yale's Spider (Semantic Parsing and Text-to-SQL Challenge) task.

**08/2019 - 05/2021**\
**Purdue University & Ford Motor Company**\
_In-Vehicle Multi-Turn Open Domain Question-Answer Systems_\
This research project is an alliance between Ford Motor Company and Purdue University’s Data Mine. We created an in-vehicle Question-Answer system utilizing the 2020MY Lincoln Aviator manual. Given a question about a user's vehicle, which can be answered from the manual, the system searches the manual and returns the most probable answer, via ALBERT for text-retrieval and BERT- based Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL) model for answers stored in tables.

# Past Reseach

**04/2019 - 12/2019**\
**University of Michigan & Ford Motor Company**\
_Smart Vehicles for a Smart World_\
The Ford initiative with the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) utilizes high-fidelity data collection technology from vehicles and intersections around Ann Arbor to collect > 2 TB of data every month to find use cases in which Ford can use the vehicle as a sensor in various mobility products, such as finding correlations between driving behaviors, quantifying driving behavior, and classifying drivers into aggression segments for Usage-Based Insurance.

**08/2017 - 12/2017**\
**Michigan State University College of Arts and Letters**\
_Translating and Analyzing Violent Language in a Vogelweide Poetry_\
The purpose of this senior research thesis, advised by Assistant Professor of Medieval Literature Tamar Boyadjian, was to translate Vogelweide’s lyric poem \textit{Ir Sult Sprechen Willekomen} from its original Middle High German to Modern German and analyze the implications of violent language used in themes of German Nationalism.

**01/2017- 05/2017**\
**Michigan State University Digital Humanities Literary Cognition Lab**\
_Neuroaesthetics: Poetry and Aesthetic Pleasure_\
This interdisciplinary project, led by MSU Professor of English Natalie Phillips, focuses on understanding the impact poetry has on a reader’s brain, utilizing fMRI imaging to discover and quantify relationships.
