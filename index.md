<h3>Welcome!</h3>

<br><br><br>

I am a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gouldju1/">Senior Data Scientist</a> working within <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://datamine.purdue.edu/">the Data mine</a> at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Purdue University</a>. My primary role is to provide technical advising to our Corporate Partnerships program-both as an advisor to students paired with corporate projects and working with fellow staff and faculty colleagues to provide analytics consulting for Fortune 500 companies. In addition to technical advising, I <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://github.com/gouldju1/tdm-foundations-of-geospatial-analytics">offer coursework</a> in Geospatial Analytics and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://arxiv.org/search/cs?searchtype=author&query=Gould%2C+J">conduct research</a> in energy-efficient distributed computing.


Prior to joining Purdue University, I worked within Natural Language Processing (Natural Language to SQL and Question & Answering) and Connected & Autonomous Vehicle Analytics at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://www.purdue.edu/">Ford Motor Company</a>. In the final six months of my time at Ford, I was a Product Owner of a suite of NLP tools and models, as well as a connected vehicle data discovery tool-both of which I helped bring into production.

I hold two degrees from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="http://www.msu.edu">Michigan State University</a>. My undergraduate work granted me a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://english.msu.edu/about/">B.A. in English Literature</a>, with Honors. In 2018, I graduated with an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://broad.msu.edu/masters/business-analytics/">M.S. in Business Analytics</a>.

In my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://broad.msu.edu/masters/business-analytics/">free time</a>, I enjoy reading, traveling, cooking and baking, biking, classical music, hiking, and rock/ice climbing.
