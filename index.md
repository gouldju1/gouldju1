<h3>Welcome!</h3>
<br>
Howdy! I am an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gouldju1/">ML/AI Scientist</a> working and conducting research primarily in the Natural Language Processing domain at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://corporate.ford.com/company.html">Ford Motor Company</a>. Specifically, I work on Question & Answering tasks, as well as IR (Information Retrieval) and NL2SQL (Natural Language to SQL). Outside of NLP, however, I have experience applying Machine Learning to ADAS (Advanced Driver-Assistance System) and connected vehicle data, contributing to high-performance geospatial analysis. 
<br><br>
I hold two degrees from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="http://www.msu.edu">Michigan State University</a>. My undergraduate work granted me a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://english.msu.edu/about/">B.A. in English Literature</a>, with Honors, where I completed my thesis on translating Walther von der Vogelweideâ€™s <i><a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="http://www.luxautumnalis.de/walther-von-der-vogelweide-ir-sult-sprechen-willekomen/">Ir Sult Sprechen Willekomen</a></i> to New High German, and analyzing the poem's extremist natioanlism through its violent language and metaphor. In 2018, I graduated from with an <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://broad.msu.edu/masters/business-analytics/">M.S. in Business Analytics</a>, where I completed a variety of coursework in Statistics, Machine Learning, Optimization, Database Management, and Corporate Strategy. A few of my many projects durng my Master's can be found on my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"  href="https://github.com/gouldju1">GitHub</a>.
<br><br>
In my free time, I enjoy reading late 16th-century-early 19th-century literature (I know that's shocking, given my undergraduate work...), learning about digital ethics and akgorithmic bias/disparity, classical music, biking, and brewing kombucha.

This site not only functions a portal to my research and work on Natural Language Processing, but also serves as a place for me to showcase my interests.
