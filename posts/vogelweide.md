<h3>Translating Vogelweide’s Ir Sult Sprechen Willekomen</h3>
<br>
11 January 2020
<br><br>
Walther von der Vogelweide—a popular German lyric poet, or Minnesänger—not only wrote, but performed his poetry for many courts in Germany and Austria as a traveling singer. Although very little about is known about Vogelweide’s life, scholars—using his surname as evidence—generally agree that prior to dedicating his life to writing and performing poetry, he was a poor knight. In German, Vogelweide breaks down to der Vogel, the bird, and die Weide, the pasture: die Vogelweide, or the bird pasture. Therefore, in English, Vogelweide’s name roughly translates to Walther of the bird pasture—paralleling his bird-like lifestyle of constant migration, too. His poem Ir Sult Sprechen Willekomen is a significant part of German heritage and history, as 19th-century German nationalists used the poem as inspiration for the German national anthem, Deutschlandleid. As a descendent of German immigrants and a lover of German culture and language, I dedicated an entire semester to diving deep into the text of this important poem to uncover into its alternative, non-medieval meaning within the scope of German nationalism through translation. While the text from a medieval perspective depicts appreciation and love for Germanic women, the translation reveals strong, modern German nationalist overtones, where the women in the poem function as a metaphor for love of country, which can be seen in the speaker’s patriotism. By analyzing the translation of Ir Sult Sprechen Willekomen and the employment of metaphor throughout the poem, as well as the speaker’s patriotic values as he professes the “Nachricht” (“news”) of the kingdoms making up modern-day “Germany” to a foreign audience, one can see how the poem’s medieval reading, through the means of translation, can be interpreted as a nationalistic narrative, and how this is exposed through the scope of translation to New High German.
<br><br>
The first stanza functions as a foundation for the various metaphors employed throughout the work. From a medieval perspective, the stanza is about a man who addresses a foreign audience with what he believes to be is great news. The implication is that the speaker is male, as the speaker is a characterized as a strong, powerful traveler; during the time period in which the poem was written, a traveler would have most likely been a male. However, as a result of the translation to New High German, the nationalist implications of the stanza are exposed, and is far different from its original meaning. Take, for example, in line 1, “Ihr sollt sprechen willkommen” (“You all should say welcome”; 1) , the speaker is proclaiming to those around him that they should welcome him into their land, “weil bringe ich ihr Nachricht” (“because I bring you all news”; 2). This brash initial statement characterizes the speaker as both strong and confident, as he assertively enters a new land demanding its citizens to embrace him. Following the establishing of the speaker’s characterization, he states that the news he brings them is greater than anything they know, as seen in lines three and four, “Alles, das ihr gehören, das ist nichts: ihr fragt mich” (Everything you have ever heard, that is nothing: ask me!”; 3-4), therefore belittling his audience by placing himself, and his land, above them in terms of status—beginning to convey the nationalistic tone of the work. The “Nachricht” (“news”) from line two is critical to the entire poem, as it is implied that this news is the speaker’s spreading of information regarding the group of realms making up present-day “Germany,” which the speaker conveys to the audience throughout the poem. The implication from the speaker placing such value on his news, as well as the belittling the foreign land’s people, is that anything Germanic is better than its foreign substitutes—a highly-nationalistic perspective. Translating the original “mære” to “Nachricht” provided a challenge in accurately depicting the correct meaning, as “Nachricht” can be the English equivalent of “message” or “news”; however, according to the Mittelhochdeutsches Wörterbuch from the Mainzer Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur and the Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Göttingen, the closest meansing is “Nachrict” or “Bericht” (“report”) . Therefore, the use of “Nachricht” as “news” is the more effective choice for translation, as the speaker is relaying an index of information in the form of news. Translating and interpreting line eight, “seht, waz man mir êren biete” had challenges, as well. “Eren,” can be interpreted as “Ehren” or as the verb “verehren,” according to the Mittelhochdeutsches Wörterbuch, meaning “honor” or “to worship” in English, respectively . Since the “Ehren” to which the speaker refers further dramatizes the speaker’s sense of nationalism, as he feels that he should be honored just for being Germanic. The speaker’s feeling entitled to honor, here, not only provides the implication that Germanic heritage, and therefore “Germany,” is better than this the audience’s society and land, but also shows that my translation and interpretation of “ëren” as “Ehren” helps to unlock the poem’s nationalistic meaning.
<br><br>
From the perspective of the poem’s likely original meaning, Ir Sult sprechen Willekomen generalizes and compares Germanic women to foreigners as a way to profess his love for one specific woman—claiming that she is better than “Alles, das ihr gehören,” which references information provided in the first stanza. The Germanic women, from a nationalistic perspective, serve as a metaphor to demonstrate “Germany’s” greatness over the rest of the world. In the praising of Germanic women, “diese Nachricht wird sie für die Welt noch attraktiver machen” (“this news will make the women even more attractive to the world”; 10), the words “noch attrakiver” (“even more attractive”) imply that the speaker already believes Germanic women are thought of as attractive to the world—as he states that their attractiveness will improve “even more.” The nationalist implication from “noch attraktiver,” on the other hand, is that “Germany” is better than “Alles, das [die fremden Leute] gehören” (“[the foreign people”])—thus placing “Germany” on a pedestal above the rest of the world. When the speaker notes that he “begehre keinen großen Lohn” (“desires no large payment/reward”; 11), again from the original, medieval reading, it shows the extent to which he loves this woman—as no reward is as valuable to him as having the ability to love this woman and tell the world of his love for her. In the original text, the speaker says “âne grôze miete tuon ich daz”(translation; 12). According to the Mittelhochdeutsches Handwörterbuch von Matthias Lexer, “âne grôze” roughly translates to “ohne große,” or “without large.  ” Since “miete” is equivalent to “Lohn” or “Behlohnung,” “salary” or “reward,” respectively, the implication is that the speaker does not need to receive a generous payment or reward for sharing the tale of his love—resulting in “begehre keinen großen Lohn.” The nationalist overtones, here, demonstrates the speaker’s declining of payment or reward demonstrates his passion and pride for his land—resulting in the implication that his ability to bring news regarding “Germany” and Germanic women is so precious and significant, that he values it as priceless.
Vogelweide does not explicitly utilize the Germanic women metaphor in the third stanza to compare the countries he visited to “Germany”; rather, it is employed implicitly, as he reverses the metaphor—where “Germany” represents a Germanic woman, and the countries he visited represent temptation from foreign women. Therefore, the medieval reading of this stanza, unlike the preceding two, is quite similar the nationalist interpretation, as the speaker is advocating his perspective that “Germany” is greater than the other countries he visited. The first two lines of this stanza not only explain the extent of the speaker’s explorations, “Ich bin in viele Länder gereist” (“I have traveled to many countries”; 17), but inform the reader that he has “sah die Allerbesten” (“seen the very best”; 18) of these countries. As a result of his experiences in other countries, the implication is that the speaker is a trustworthy source to assess these countries. From the medieval perspective, the speaker’s comparison of countries implicitly refers to his love for the Germanic woman, because of the reversal of the roles in the metaphor. In the proceeding lines, the speaker negates any established reliability by introducing an obvious bias in his assessment—which, in turn, further reveals the poem’s nationalistic tone by exposing the speaker’s disdain toward anything not Germanic. The speaker explains that he shall be deeply saddened, should he come to enjoy other countries’ cultures and its peoples: “Aber wehe ist ich wenn ich mein Herz jemals überzeugen kann fremd genießen” (“Woe is me if I can ever convince my heart to enjoy something else”; 19-21).
<br><br>
The original, medieval meaning derived from the above quote is that the speaker shan’t love another woman—especially a woman from another land. This medieval reading directly feeds into the nationalist perspective, as the speaker is conveying intense love of land through his employment of patriotism by exaggerating the possibility that he could appreciate a non-Germanic land. In the final line, the notions of love, from the medieval perspective, and nationalism are expanded: “Deutsche Zucht ist besser als alle anderen” (“German breeding is better than everything else”; 24), as the speaker believes that Germanic offspring are better than those from other countries, implied to be from the “viele Länder” (“many countries”) he visited. Therefore, the speaker’s confidence in Germanic breeding results in the implications that this is what sets Germanic women apart, and why he has fallen in love with one, as well as what makes “Germany” better than other countries, as Germanic people, from a religious perspective, are divinely born, blessed at birth. Appropriately translating the final line, “tiuschiu zuht gât vor in allen,” was challenging, considering its implications on both the medieval and modern German readings of the poem. According to the Mittelhochdeutsches Wörterbuch, “zuht” translates to “zucht” or “zühte”—“breed” or “bred,” respectively . Since the speaker is discussing Germanic children and births, translating “zuht” to “zucht,” was the most viable option in order to preserve the poem’s meaning in an attempt to enhance both the medieval and nationalist interpretations.
<br><br>
The speaker once again references his time in other European countries in the beginning of the fourth stanza: “Von der Elbe bis zum Rhein und wieder nach Ungarn sind wahrscheinlich die besten Leute, den ich jemals in der ganzen Welt getroffen habe” (“From the Elbe to the Rhine and back to Hungary are probably the best people I've ever met in the world”; 25-28). Since both the Elbe and the Rhine rivers flow primarily through “Germany,” but run into other countries in Europe, by saying that “die besten Leute” (“the best people”; 27) he has ever seen come from this land, the implication is that the people to whom the speaker is referring are Germanic. From the medieval perspective, the speaker’s assessment that the Germanic people are “die besten Leute,” is similar to the previous stanza in the sense that he implicitly recalls the reference to the metaphor of the Germanic woman he loves. Just as Germans’ superior breeding brought about the woman with whom he is in love, the speaker is once again complimenting his true love by complementing all Germanic people. This appraisal of Germanic people also forms a nationalist narrative in which the speaker continues to share propagandized, pro-Germanic “Nachricht” to the audience from the first stanza. “[D]ie betsen Leute[s]” gender is depicted at the end of the stanza: “mit Gott” (“with God”; 31), the speaker notes that “würde ich schwören, dass hier die Frauen sind besser als irgendwo sonst” (“I swear that the women here are better than elsewhere”; 31-33).
<br><br>
The women (“die Frauen”) in the above quote refers back to “die besten Leute” described earlier in the stanza—where the incorporation of God and Christianity in the speaker’s opinion of women enhances the nationalistic tone of the stanza, by referring to the religious implication established in the previous stanza. Germanic women, according to the speaker, have both “gutes Benehmen und gutes Aussehen” (“good behavior and good looks”; 30). Just as, from the medieval perspective, the speaker uses his generalized statement that Germanic people are “die besten Leute” to compliment his beloved, the same happens here, too—again stereotyping all Germans to have “gutes Benehmen und gutes Aussehen,” meaning that his true love possesses these qualities, too. The translation of line 30 is crucial to unlocking this medieval meaning. From the original text, “guot gelâz unt lîp,” there were a couple possible interpretations in New High German : “gelâz” as “Benehmen” (“behavior”) or “gestalt” (“shape, form”). “Gestalt,” according to the Oxford English Dictionary, not only is the shape or form of something, but can also refer to Gestalt psychology, in which perceptions are studied . Therefore, “gestalt,” in regard to the Gestalt psychology, is related to “Benehmen” in the sense that one’s behavior is assessed as a perception from one’s values—making the translation more difficult. However, in the context of this stanza, “Benehmen” is the more logical option. Since the Germanic women are used as a metaphor to represent the land of “Germany” and the Germanic people, both parties obtain the aesthetics assigned to the women, whereas the Germans are recognizable for their behavior, similar to how the women are perceived as being “sind besser als irgendwo sonst” (“better than elsewhere”) which “den ich jemals in der ganzen Welt getroffen habe” (“I’ve ever met in the world”), “Germany,” naturally, must, from the nationalist perspective, be the best land in the world.
<br><br>
The speaker, because of his self-established worldly opinion, claims that “Deutsche Männer sind gut aufgenommen, und die Frauen sind wie die Engel” (“German men are well-regarded, and the women are like angels”; 34-35). Just as in previous stanzas in which the Germanic women functioned as a metaphor for “Germany” and Germanic culture, both the women and men in this stanza are metaphors from broth a medieval and nationalist perspective. The implication from the medieval reading is that he is again generalizing Germanic people to use them as a metaphor to discuss the love he has for a specific woman. Since his true love is Germanic, she receives the characterization of being an “Engel”—therefore further expanding his love for her by complementing her. On the other hand, the speaker is promoting the ideas of nationalism in the sense that “Germany,” just like “Deutsche Männer” (“German men”), is received well by others, and that the Germanic people are comparable to angels. As a result of this statement and the nationalist messages from the previous stanzas, “Germany” is portrayed as a utopia—where the speaker’s self-perceived construction of “Germany” is viewed as flawless, where the landscapes are beautiful, and the people are “Engel” (“angels”). This highly nationalistic notion is expanded when the speaker further demonstrates his love of “country” by making a recommendation to his audience: “Wenn jemand nach Tugend und reiner Liebe sucht, wird er in unser Land kommen” (“If someone searches for virtue and pure love, he shall come to our country”; 38-39).
<br><br>
The speaker’s remark from the above quote implies that “Germany”—a utopia with “gutes Aussehen,” and “Engel” citizens—also evokes the qualities of “Tugend” (“virtue”) and “reiner Liebe” (“pure love”), indicating that these attractive traits are engrained in the fabric of Germanic culture, meaning the woman with whom he is in love possesses these qualities since she is Germanic. Furthermore, this, from a medieval standpoint, further professes his love for his true love by claiming that anyone wanting to experience these values—implied as himself—should come to “Germany,” and because “Germany” functions as a metaphor for her, the implication is that the speaker should love this woman for the qualities she possesses. From the nationalist perspective, the speaker’s commentary is not used metaphorically, which suggests that he is literally advocating for foreigners to come to “Germany” in hopes of finding “Tugend” and “rein’er Liebe.” The nationalism expressed, here, is unlocked through the translation of “reine minne” to reiner Liebe.” “Tugend” is translated clearly from “tugent”; however, going from “minne” to “Liebe” required the use of Matthew Lexer’s Mittelhochdeutsches Handwörterbuch. According to this Middle High German dictionary, “minne” has various meaning associated with “Liebe” (“love”)—such as religious, parental, and friendship forms of love. I see one common root shared between these types of loves and loving relationships—that each one, in theory, is sincere and pure; this commonality is depicted in the original text of poem, as Vogelweide uses “reine” (“pure” to describe this idea of “minne.”
<br><br>
Moreover, the traits the speaker uses to describe “Germany” add to the nationalistic, utopian image of the land, as “Tugend” refers to the idea of “die Engel” (“Angel” citizens), possessing “gutes Benehmen” (“good behavior”), and “reiner Liebe” implies that Germanic people are truly “die betsen Leute,” as having strong, wholesome morals. “[W]ird er in unser Land kommen” has a significant nationalistic implication, too—especially with the use of the word “unser” (“our”). If the notion of nationalism is rooted in the idea of advocating the “interests of one's own nation,” as defined by the Oxford English Dictionary , and is the love of, and pride in, one’s land, then not only is the speaker asserting the role of a medieval version of a German nationalist, as he promotes his land by belittling other nations, but when he welcomes people into “unser Land” (“our country”), he is implying communal ownership of “Germany”—that it is the place for all to experience the aforementioned qualities, where a foreign person can forsake their old, inferior ways, to become a proud “Engel” Germanic, too. Therefore, the speaker further promotes “Germany” by attempting to recruit people to help grow “Germany’s” influence in the world.
<br><br>
In the final stanza, the speaker takes the metaphor of Germanic women, and singles out one Germanic woman, implied to be the woman with whom he is in love, to represent “Germany”—explaining his devotion to this woman, despite the way she treats him. The first three lines of the stanza, from the medieval reading, function as the foundation of the speaker’s commitment to his true love, as he is professing his deep love and admiration for a Germanic woman: “Die, die ich lange gedient habe und die ich immer mehr gerne diene, [i]ch gebe nicht auf” (“The one I served for a long time and I will always be happy to serve more, I will not give that up”; 42-44). In addition to establishing the length which the speaker has “gedient” (“served”) “Germany,” again functioning as a mepathor for the woman, as “lange” (“long”), providing insight into the speaker’s older age—which, in turn, has the implication of making him appear as wiser, due to the preconceived notion of becoming wiser with age. The speaker explicitly states the joy he gets from promoting this woman, “ich immer gerne deine” (“I always like to serve”), and that he will always serve her: “[i]ch gebe nicht auf” (“I will not give that up”). From a nationalist perspective, this strong love is not for a woman, but rather “Germany”—for the speaker pledges his life to advocating pro-”Germany” causes, expanding the impact of the poem’s nationalist narrative. Lines 42-44 are critical for both the medieval reading and nationalist overtones of the stanza, effectively conveying its meaning in New High German is important, and helps to unlock the meaning of the poem. In the original text, Vogelweide writes, “und iemer mêre gerne dienen wil.” “Iemer” is close to the New High German word “immer,” meaning always, and “dienen wil” is roughly equivalent to “gerne diene,” or “happy/like to serve.” The missing information, here, is “mêre,” which, according to Joseph Wright’s A Middle High German Primer, means “mehr,” or “more”—implying that the speaker will attempt to serve “Germany”/his love even more than he already does . Combining Wright’s translation of “mêre” with my knowledge of New High German, the line reads as is, helping to enable readers to discover the effects of the metaphors of “Germany” and Germanic women to show the speaker’s perceived love of his beloved and land. The speaker stating that he will not abandon his role as a nationalist, even though “Sie verletzt mich in meinem Herzen und in meinem Sinn” (“She hurts me in my head and in my mind”; 46-47), is significant, as the ways in which “Germany” “verletzt” (“hurts”) the speaker expose his skepticism toward “Germany” and loving this woman, but how he disregards them. By receiving pain in the heart, the speaker admits confusion as to whom he loves. Does he really love this woman? Does he really love “Germany”? The mind, on the other hand, shows his skepticism regarding his blind following and support of his land, perhaps asking himself, is this the most logical approach? The fact that the speaker is willing to look past these flaws and ignore his criticisms expands his nationalism, as he comes second to “Germany,” showing that his land comes before him.
<br><br>
Throughout Ir Sult Sprechen Willekomen, Vogelweide uses Germanic women as a metaphor to represent the land of now modern-day “Germany”—which, in the medieval context, demonstrates the passionate love the speaker feels for a Germanic woman. I spent an entire semester diving into the original, Middle High German text to translate it to Modern High German. As a result of my translation, I uncovered strong nationalist overtones in each stanza—which corrupted the idea of the medieval love poem, and transformed it into a love of country. The translation process opened my eyes not only to the nationalism exposed by the New High German text, but prompted the question of preserving the meaning of the original poem. My family is mostly German, and I am incredibly interested in German culture and language, so translating to German not only enabled me to expand my German skills, but made me wonder if I could avoid reading the poem in terms of the modern conceptualization, based on what I now know about the poem. In other words, just as the translation exposed these nationalist overtones, does my role as translator prohibit me from reading the work in any other way. I believe the answer to this question is no. Throughout this analysis of the text, I was able to separate my thought process from the modern meaning of the poem to focus on both the language, as well as the medieval interpretation of the work, to better interpret the text and make changes to my translation. In fact, I believe that the translation processed enhanced my ability to see the work from different perspectives by forcing me to think critically about the language and its implications. With that being said, one of my greatest takeaways from this semester was learning how to approach translation. Since this was my first translation process, the beginning stages were overwhelming—not knowing which sources to use, how to approach the text, and interpreting the nationalist overtones after I discovered them. From this experience, in the future, I would definitely go through the text stanza-by-stanza again, but would worry less about accuracy, and more about interpretation of the meaning of the stanza, from a low level, and eventually the poem as a whole.
