## Selected Projects


| **Industry** | **Business Problem** | **Technical Challenge** | **Scope** | **Outcome** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Energy & Utilities | A major energy distributor struggled with manual FEMA reimbursement processing after a hurricane, causing bottlenecks and delays. | Accelerate and automate FEMA document processing to unlock recovery funds. | Led a team to build custom OCR models for FEMA forms. Used Azure Document Intelligence, PostgreSQL, and QC dashboards for review. | Cut processing time by 90%, enabling $60M in reimbursements and 3x contract growth. Infrastructure reused across future projects. |
| Healthcare | NY healthcare payors faced CMS penalties due to bad directory data. | Build audit simulation tools to improve data quality before federal audits. | Designed a rules-based and ML-augmented audit simulator. Created synthetic data, risk dashboards, and compliance scores. | Improved audit performance by 15% and reduced penalties. Created a reusable quarterly compliance process. |
| Healthcare | A home healthcare provider was near bankruptcy with fragmented data and outdated systems. | Lead an enterprise data transformation for care, compliance, and financial ops. | Managed a 15-person team. Migrated data to Azure, implemented governance with Collibra, and built a Patient 360 solution. | Delivered $5M+ in value through improved analytics and operational efficiency. Stabilized IT during leadership changes. |
| Life Sciences / Pharma | A pharmaceutical tech firm needed a way to assist technicians with clinical questions. | Deliver a secure, LLM-powered chatbot for pharmacy techs. | Architected a solution using LangChain, CrewAI, and FAISS for RAG. Built with GPT-4 and added access controls. | Deployed to BETA portal, reducing technician wait time and demonstrating safe GenAI use. |
| Healthcare / Legal Services | MRI client lacked visibility into PI market prospects across fragmented data. | Build a unified CRM dataset from external legal and medical sources. | Created ML pipelines using record linkage and NLP. Unified bar, payer, and court data; integrated into Salesforce. | Boosted usable CRM data by 90%, enhancing sales and marketing targeting. |
| MedTech | Medtech partner needed real-time tissue detection during colonoscopies. | Build a deep learning model for live abnormality detection. | Trained a PyTorch CNN on endoscopic video. Optimized for real-time inference and low latency. | Achieved 90% F1 score. Model performance supported clinical trial readiness. |
| Consumer Goods | A global CPG client’s GenAI system was built on legacy AWS infrastructure. | Migrate to Azure and refactor for scalable GenAI workloads. | Re-architected platform using Azure Functions, SQL, and AKS. Containerized GPT microservices. | Cut infrastructure cost by 30% and reduced deployment time from weeks to hours. |
| Automotive | Automotive OEM faced battery defects with unclear causes. | Identify battery defects in real-time from factory cameras. | Built a hierarchical CNN with Keras/TensorFlow. Deployed explainable ML with Grad-CAM and MLOps integration. | Reached 92% F1 and secured $45M supplier contract after successful PoC. |
| Software / DevOps | Data mismatches across dev/staging/prod environments were delaying releases. | Ensure real-time data sync across environments. | Built CDC pipeline using Debezium, Kafka, and Postgres. Added schema validation and topic automation. | Reduced data sync issues by 95%, speeding up DevOps cycles. |
| Manufacturing | Engine manufacturer needed to predict engine failure from service logs. | Build a predictive NLP model for engine end-of-life. | Fine-tuned BERT for entity extraction. Built predictive pipeline and deployed with MLflow APIs. | Delivered 28% lift in F1 and enabled warranty-based decision-making. |
| Automotive | Ford lacked data on customer driving behavior for hands-free features. | Reconstruct driving routes from sparse telematics data. | Used PySpark to process 10M+ events. Rebuilt routes using spatio-temporal clustering and test drive validation. | Reached ~90% accuracy and secured investment for production rollout. |
| Automotive | Owner’s manual chatbot couldn’t handle structured data. | Enable natural language querying of structured databases. | Enhanced transformer-based Text-to-SQL model with semantic parsing and schema grounding. | Hit 91% accuracy, filed invention disclosure, and demoed at Ford’s global data conference. |
| Automotive | Built a Q&A chatbot on vehicle manuals. | Create a scalable, in-vehicle question-answering tool. | Combined ElasticSearch and BERT-based QA. Deployed to Ford’s Kubernetes platform with SSO. | Achieved 98% accuracy. Tool became top resource for engineering and compliance. |
